When managers or researchers are interested in the response of categorical performance indicators to changes in scale and categorical explanatory variables, then Bayesian networks (BNs) are useful.This BN is a collection of nodes relating to managerial positions in fishery department,fisher's representation,their conflicts,compliances and equity issues.

Nodes description:

Management_type : One of the root nodes that defines three types of managerial positions,namely, govt, co operation-management and trad

Fisher_Density : It is a root node which tells about the density of fisher's in an area.

Stability : A leaf node dependent on Management type. Stability is an evidence of Management type.

Democ_Elected : An internal node which describes that Management type defines if the Fisher Representative in Election is democratically elected.

Fisher_Representation : An internal node that relates to Democ_Elected and Management_Type in a way that they control a fisher's representation in rule making.

Respectability : A leaf node whichvthe guides management decision-making in respect of particular objectives.

Conflict_Resolution : Data and information to help resolve conflict is contained within the management plan.

Gears : Types of gears used and their catchability varies seasonally in response to the prevailing fishing conditions. The information about their availability is obtained from the management.

Clear_Access_Rights : The number of “outsiders” who should be allow access to fisher's local resources (co-management units) without impacting on their own catches.

Control_Surveillance : Monitoring absolute abundance of fish stocks using biomass survey methods is done as directed by the fishers.

Poaching : Gives an estimation of quantity of fish poached in an area in a specific period of time.

Compliance : It gives a degree of compliance to the rules set up by the fisher representative.

CPUE_change : 'Catch per unit effort' (CPUE) is monitored as an index of stock size although the underlying assumption that CPUE is proportional to abundance may not always be satisfied.

Equity : The quality of being fair and impartial is dependent on Conflict Resolution and Gears availability from the management.


Inferences:

Causal : Management Types, Conflict Resolution and Equity are in the Causal Inference chain,implying that changing the value of Equity, effects Management Types.

Evidential : Clear_Access_Rights, Fisher_Density and CPUE_Change are in the Evidential Chain,implying that,changing the value of CPUE_Change effects Clear_Access_Rights and Fisher_Density.This is also a case of 'Common Effect'.

Intercausal : Stability and Fisher_Representation are non-descendents but changing the value of one,effects another. This is also a case of 'Common Cause'.
